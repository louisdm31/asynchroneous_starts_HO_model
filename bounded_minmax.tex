We parameter our algorithm by a function $\delta$ in $\mathds{N} \rightarrow \mathds{N}$.
We assume that it fulfills the following constraints:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \delta(t) = \infty.$
	\item $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} t-\delta(t) = \infty.$
\end{itemize}

\end{algorithm}

We define the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $m_i(t) = min \{\mu_j, j \in In_i^a(0:t)\}$
	\item $m_i^* = min_{t \in \mathds{N}} m_i(t)$
	\item $m^* = max_{i \in \Pi} m_i^*$
\end{itemize}

We assume the following hypothesis:

$$\exists D \in \mathds{N}, \exists \gamma \in \Pi, \exists t \in \mathds{N}, \forall t' > t, \forall i \in \Pi, \gamma \in In_i(t':t'+D).$$

\begin{lem} \label{lem:stabX}
	For all $i \in \Pi$, for any round $t$, we have $x_i(t) = m_i(t)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	We prove this lemma by induction over $t$.
	The base case results from the initialization of $x_i$.
	For the inductive case, we have:

	$$m_i(t+1) = min \{m_j(t), j \looparrowright i\} = min \{x_j(t), j \looparrowright i\} = x_i(t+1).$$
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:stabM}
	$m_\gamma^* = m^*$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $t$ be the first round from which $m_\gamma(t) = m^*_\gamma$ and the graph $\mathds{G}(t:t+D)$ is centered.
	By hypothesis, for every $i \in \Pi$, we have $\gamma \in In_i(t:t+D)$.
	Hence $In_\gamma^a(0:t) \subseteq In_i^a(0:t+D)$.
	Then, $m_i^* \leq m_i(t+D) \leq m_\gamma(t) = m_\gamma^*$.
	Thus $m_\gamma^* = m^*$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:learnBound}
	$\forall i \in \Pi, \exists t \in \mathds{N}, \forall t' > t, \delta(T_i^{t'}) > D \vee y_i^{t'} \geq m^*$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	We partition $\Pi$ into two subsets: $\Pi_{fin}$ contains the nodes whose $T$ variable ultimately stabilize, whereas $\Pi_{inf}$ contains the nodes
	whose $T$ variable goes to infinity.
	We consider the first round $t$ in which every node is active, and its $m_i(t)$ has already stabilized,
	and every node in $i \in \Pi_{inf}$ verifies $\delta(T_i^t) > D$,
	and the $T$ variable of every node in $\Pi_{fin}$ has already stabilized,
	and the dynamic graph verifies $\forall t' > t, \forall i \in \Pi, \gamma \in In_i(t':t'+D)$.
	By contradiction, we assume that there exists some node $i \in \Pi$
	such that, in some round $t' > t$, we have $\delta(T_i^{t'}) \leq D \wedge y_i^{t'} < m^*$.
	Using the assumption on the dynamic graph, we can obtain a path $(\gamma = j(0), j(1), \dots, j(D) = i)$,
	such that $\forall h < D, j(h) \in In_{j(h+1)}(t'+h+1)$.

	We can show by backward induction on this path that every node on this path belongs to $\Pi_{fin}$.
	For the base case, we know that the value of $\delta(T_i)$ must have stabilized to some value below $D$.
	Whereas the value $\delta(T_j)$ of every node in $\Pi_{inf}$ is assumed to have already overcome $D$ in round $t'$.
	For the inductive case, we use the line \ref{line:maxT} to prove that every node on the path verifies $\delta(T_{j(h)}^{t'+h}) < D$.

	We can show by induction on this path that:

	$$\forall h < D, y_{j(h)}^{t'+h} \geq m^*$$

	For the base case, we have $y_\gamma^{t'} \geq x_\gamma^{t'} = m^*$.
	This results from the lemmas \ref{lem:stabX} and \ref{lem:stabM}, and the assumption that $m_\gamma(t')$ is supposed to be stabilized already.
	For the induction case, we assume that $y_{j(h)}^{t'+h} \geq m^*$.
	We cannot have $y_{j(h+1)}^{t'+h+1} < m^*$, otherwise $j(h+1)$ would execute the line \ref{line:increm}. We showed that $j(h+1)$ was belonging to $\Pi_{fin}$,
	and its $T_{j(h+1)}$ is supposed to be stabilized already.
	
	We ultimately have $y_i^{t'+D} \geq m^*$, which leads to a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:supprOld}
	$\forall i \in \Pi, \exists t \in \mathds{N}, \forall t' > t, y_i^{t'} \leq m^*$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	Let $t$ be the first round in which every $m_i(t)$ has already stabilized.
	We show by induction over $t'$ that $\forall v > m^*, \forall t' \in \mathds{N}, min_{i \in \Pi} AGE_i^{t+t'}[v] \geq t'$.
	For the induction case, we know that no node verifies $x_i^{t+t'} > m^*$. We use the line \ref{line:minAGE} to prove this case.
	We also have $\forall t \in \mathds{N}, max_{i \in \Pi} T_i^t \leq t$. That can be proved by induction over $t$.
	Finally, using $\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} t-\delta(t) = \infty$, we ultimately have $AGE_i^t[v] > \delta(T_i^t)$ and $v \notin max \{v \in \mathcal{V}, AGE_i[v] < \infty\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	The $BoudedMinMax$ algorithm solves consensus with finite amount of memory.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	We want to show that we ultimately have $y_i^t = m^*$ for every $i \in \Pi$.
	We consider a round $t$ from which lemmas \ref{lem:supprOld} and \ref{lem:learnBound} is verified, and from which the graph is centered with delay $D$.
	We consider a node $i \in \Pi$, and we show that $\forall t' \geq t+D, y_i^{t'} \geq m^*$.
	Using the assumption on the dynamic graph, we can obtain a path $(\gamma = j(0), j(1), \dots, j(D) = i)$,
	such that $\forall h < D, j(h) \in In_{j(h+1)}(t'-D+h+1)$.
	We show by induction over $h$ that $\forall h \leq D, AGE_{j-h}^{t'-D+h}[m^*] \leq h$.
	For the inductive case, we assume that $AGE_{j-h}^{t'-D+h} \leq h$.
	We must have $\delta(T_{j(h+1)}^{t'-D+h+1}) > h+1$.
	Otherwise, line \ref{line:cut} would be executed by $j(h+1)$. We would obtain $m^* \notin max \{v \in \mathcal{V}, AGE_i[v] < \infty\}$.
	Lemma \ref{lem:supprOld} would imply $y_{j(h+1)}^{t'-D+h+1} < m^*$, that would violate lemma \ref{lem:learnBound}.
	Once we have $\delta(T_{j(h+1)}^{t'-D+h+1}) > h+1$, we can conclude the inductive case using line \ref{line:minAGE}.

	We obtain $AGE_i^{t'}[m^*] \leq D$. We can conclude the proof using lemma \ref{lem:supprOld}.
	Moreover, once the nodes have stabilized to the decision value, the line \ref{line:increm} cannot be executed.
	This means that the $T_i$ variables are bounded, thus the memory used is finite.
\end{proof}
